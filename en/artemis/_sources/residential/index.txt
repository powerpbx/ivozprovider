Residential clients are a special type of company that only provide a connectivity
service with carriers through residential devices.

    brand domain to unequivocally identify their accounts. You'll need to configure
    Brand's domain to use this feature.

.. hint:: Residential clients can be enabled per Brand basis via Features.

The goal of this section will be describe each of the configuration settings
